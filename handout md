# ðŸŒž Solar Jetbot Project: Agile Affinity Group Handout

## ðŸ§  Affinity Group: Agile for Embedded Systems

Welcome to the affinity group focused on applying **Agile methods** to embedded systems development!  
We are working on an exciting hands-on project to build and optimize a **Solar Jetbot** that can track the sun in **two degrees of freedom (2DoF)**.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Goal: Sun Tracking System

### ðŸ§© Problem Statement

Given **sunrise and sunset events** and real-time geographic location, develop an algorithm and hardware control system that:

- Tracks the **azimuth** and **elevation** of the sun (2DoF)
- Optimizes **energy capture** for a solar-powered Jetbot
- Proves the **optimality** of tracking for daily energy efficiency

## ðŸŒ€ Agile Concepts Youâ€™ll Learn

### ðŸ“š Key Concepts

- **User Stories**: Define features from the userâ€™s perspective
- **Backlog**: Prioritized list of features and tasks
- **Sprints**: Time-boxed development iterations (1-2 weeks)
- **Story Points**: Relative effort assigned to user stories
- **Velocity**: Rate at which a team delivers story points per sprint
- **Epic**: A larger body of work that spans multiple stories

### ðŸ›  Example User Story

```
As a system designer,
I want to compute solar azimuth and elevation based on time and location,
So that the panel can align optimally with the sun.
```

## ðŸ¤– Hardware Involved

- Jetbot (NVIDIA Jetson Nano)
- 2x Servo motors for 2DoF solar panel movement
- GPS module or manually entered coordinates
- RTC for time synchronization
- Optional: Solar irradiance sensor

---

## ðŸ§ª Activities and Roles

### ðŸ‘¨â€ðŸ’» Code-Centric Group
- Write Python/C++ code for angle computation and control
- Integrate with Jetbot hardware and sensors

### ðŸŽ¨ Design-Centric Group
- Define and refine user stories and epics
- Design simulations and UI for performance visualization

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Agile Practice

- **Daily Standups** (15 mins): Share progress, blockers
- **Sprint Planning**: Select stories for the upcoming sprint
- **Retrospective**: Reflect on what went well, what to improve
- **Demo**: Present the Jetbot tracking system at the end of each sprint
